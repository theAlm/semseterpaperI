Abstract
Since deep convolutional neural networks based on semi-discrete frames have lead to breakthrough results in feature extraction applications, Wiatowski and Bölcskei developed Mallat's scattering network theory further. They introduced the generalized feature extractor, using different semi-discrete frames in each layer, while scattering networks are constructed by using the same wavelet-based  semi-discrete frames in every layer. Furthermore the stability of the feature extractor with respect to deformations of R-band-limited signals is shown for a more general type of non-linear small deformations and translation invariance is proven, whereas the proofs are detached from many technical conditions relative to scattering networks. This semester paper explicates the construction, proofs and suggested applications, in particular wavelet-frames and Gabor frames, by  Wiatowski and Bölcskei.
